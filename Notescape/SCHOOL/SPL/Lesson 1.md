## Introduction and overview
 Languages are a framework for problem solving.
 Programming languages are notations that provide the rules for programming.
 Programming Paradigms are ways of thinking about programming.

## History of Programming Languages
Programming started in the 19th century between 1842-1843.

### Prominent Names
- Ada Lovelace (created the memoir translator for the Bernoulli numbers).
- Luigi Menabra (Italian Mathematician).
- Charles Babbage (Analytical machine and Difference Engine).
- Herman Hollerith (Punch Cards).

The first computer language was assembly language(machine code) created in the 1940s but new PLs started as a result of assembly being error prone and also requires a lot of intellectual effort.

In the 1950s the first PLs to communicate instructions to the computer where known as high level PLs.

## Programming Paradigms

Paradigm is defined as the various system of ideas used to guide the design of PLs. It is also a model that forms the basis of something.

### Examples of Paradigms

#### Imperative Programming 

is the programming style based on specific operations described through statements, consequent commands and actions. Languages recognize the fact that computers have re-usable memory that can change state. [[#Procedural Programming]] and [[#Object Oriented Programming]] are derivatives.

#### Logic Programming

This views computation as automates reasoning over corpus knowledge. Facts about the problem domain are expressed as logic formulae, and programs are executes by applying inference rules over them until an answer to the problem is found. It focuses on predicate logic. It has the tendency of a [[#Declarative Programming]] nature.

#### Functional Programming

It is a subtype of the [[#Declarative Programming]] style. Functions are treated as the core, programs are executed by evaluation expressions rather than statements that change some state. They have only one return value; in pure functions there are no loop statements it can only be done through recursion. It defends code modularity and promotes code maintainability.

#### Object Oriented Programming

Follows the idea of classes and concrete instances representing objects from the real world rather than from machine point of view. Properties include Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance and Abstraction.

#### Procedural Programming

It is built around the idea of building procedures, functions and / or routines to improve code modularity and organization. Although functions are represented in this PP, it is said to be of [[#Imperative Programming]] style.

#### Declarative Programming 

Focuses on what should be accomplished rather than how exactly; the command flow is not specified but the focus is the result.

#### Structural Programming

also known as modular programming refers to PLs that support structured flow-control; It focuses on separation of concerns, modularity and reusability. All modern PLs are structural. Only Assembly does not support any structural syntax.

#### Others
- Symbolic Programming.
- Literate Programming.
