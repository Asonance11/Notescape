## Introduction and overview
 Languages are a framework for problem solving.
 Programming languages are notations that provide the rules for programming.
 Programming Paradigms are ways of thinking about programming.

## History of Programming Languages
Programming started in the 19th century between 1842-1843.

### Prominent Names
- Ada Lovelace (created the memoir translator for the Bernoulli numbers).
- Luigi Menabra (Italian Mathematician).
- Charles Babbage (Analytical machine and Difference Engine).
- Herman Hollerith (Punch Cards).

The first computer language was assembly language(machine code) created in the 1940s but new PLs started as a result of assembly being error prone and also requires a lot of intellectual effort.

In the 1950s the first PLs to communicate instructions to the computer where known as high level PLs.

## Programming Paradigms

Paradigm is defined as the various system of ideas used to guide the design of PLs. It is also a model that forms the basis of something.
